								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>Sup, and welcome to this single page! In this page, I'll explaining you guys <b style="font-weight: bold;">What is Waifu, My Waifu List, and Others More</b>. So, Let's get started!</p>								
								<h2>What is Waifu</h2>
								<p>If you're weebs or you're lives in Indonesia, maybe you as Normal People or Weebs itself, You guys have listened <b style="font-weight: bold;">"Waifu"</b>, But you don't know what it's meaning. So, Let me explaining this for you.</p>
                                <p>We can say if <code>"Waifu' === "Wife" // true</code>. Yep, That's meaning of Waifu. is something like ... (Are you don't know what is wife? OMG, Go search and ask to Google). So That's meaning from Waifu. It's equals and same like Wife.</p>
                                <p>
                                    And it's used by many weebs in this world. They said something like :
                                    <blockquote>
                                        Hey, I have 4 new waifus! The name is [****, *****, ******, ****]; They are so cuute and beautiful &lt;3.<br>Kyaaa &lt;///&gt; (Flooshed Face)
                                    </blockquote>
                                </p>
                                <p>By default, Weebs (including me xD) can have <code>Unlimited numbers</code> of waifu. Really, i'm not joking or something. But it's true, Many weebs simp for 2D Girls, and some weebs simp for 3D Girls (Seiryuu of the anime, or Japanese Girl). I'm very sure about this.</p>
                                <p>

                                <h2>Why you simp for VTubers? They're is a Male!</h2>
                                <p>Wait what? Vtubers is a male?! Are you really? Are you don't want to revisioning back your question? Ok, got it!</p>
                                <p>The First question from me is : <b style="font-weight: bold;">Are you sure 100% If many Vtubers is a male?</b></p>
                                <p>Second question is : <b style="font-weight: bold;">Where you got this information? Lemme know something.</b></p>
                                <p>But, I have my opinion.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>I Just like the 2D Models and The character. Not the person who host the character in the real. So, I Don't care if the real person who host the character is a male. The 2D Models Still Female. And i like it.</li>
                                    <li>If the Real Person is Male, Good things to know is <b style="font-weight: bold;">Oh, Okay</b>. Because the Character still a Female. Idfc</li>
                                    <li>If the Real Person is Female, It's good to know! So, there is no any conflict again.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>So, If i know the real person is not a female, I willn't shock about this. Cuz i just like the character. Not the Real Person.</p>
                                <h2>That's it</h2>
                                <p>That's it guys! Previously, I'm writing this page to showcasing my waifu list, But i'm now Explaining and Answering some Questions from you guys.

After reading this page, Do you want to have an Waifu?</p>
                                <p>It's not problem having a waifu like me, It can Helps you Recovering your Mentals, Makes you happier, and Others more! It's safe to having a 2D Wife, You can simp for Anime Characters, Game (Genshin Impact, etc) Characters, or Vtubers if you want.
