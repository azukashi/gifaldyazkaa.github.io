## Installation

Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

    $ cd themes
    $ git clone https://github.com/antonpolishko/hugo-stellar-theme

For more information read the official [setup guide](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

## Getting started
After installing the Hugo Stellar Theme it requires a just few more steps to get your site running.

### The config file
Take a look inside the [`exampleSite`](//github.com/antonpolishko/hugo-stellar-theme/tree/master/exampleSite) folder of this theme. You'll find a file called [`config.toml`](//github.com/schmanat/hugo-highlights-theme/tree/master/exampleSite/config.toml)


All icons are part of Fontawesome's icon font. Look at the website of [Fontawesome](//fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) for more icons. The icons are represented by their corresponding CSS class of Fontawesome. 

### Nearly finished
In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server.

    $ hugo server

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.
